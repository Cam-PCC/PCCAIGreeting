# **App Name**: VocalizeAI

## Core Features:

- Text Input: Input text into a text area.
- Audio Conversion using Deepgram Aura 2: Convert text to audio using Deepgram's Aura 2 API based on the selected audio model. Use the LLM to reason on the input text to create the audio output in an optimal way. Treat Deepgram Aura 2 like a tool that might need other external services in order to improve its functionality.
- Model Selection: Dropdown menu to select from available Deepgram audio models.
- Audio Playback: Play the converted audio directly in the app.
- Audio Export: Option to export the converted audio to a file (e.g., MP3, WAV).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0CFEC) to evoke a sense of calm and clarity, aligning with the app's function of clear audio conversion.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7) for a clean and neutral interface, ensuring readability and focus.
- Accent color: Warm orange (#E59866) to highlight key actions like the convert and export buttons, creating visual interest.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' for a modern, clean, and highly readable sans-serif typeface that suits both headings and body text.
- Simple, clean icons for audio controls (play, pause, stop, export).
- Clean and intuitive layout with a clear text input area and easily accessible audio controls.
- Subtle animations to provide feedback on actions, like a loading animation during audio conversion.
